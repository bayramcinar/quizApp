# quizApp
In this project, I made a quiz website. While making this, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. I got the questions from the internet by using web scarping in python. There are time and point in the app. You can see the true answer when you choosed a section. The app selects 10 random questions from the data. I learned making counter.
